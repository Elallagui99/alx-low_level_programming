## _Tasks_

0. putchar
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

	* The program should return 0
_Repo_
	* file: 0-putchar.c


1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
_mandatory_

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

	* Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
	* You can only use _putchar twice in your code
_Repo_
	* file: 1-alphabet.c


2. 10 x alphabet
_mandatory_

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

	* Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
	* You can only use _putchar twice in your code
_Repo_
	* File: 2-print_alphabet_x10.c


3. islower
mandatory

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

    Prototype: int _islower(int c);
    Returns 1 if c is lowercase
    Returns 0 otherwise
Repo:
File: 3-islower.c


4. isalpha
mandatory

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

    Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
    Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
    Returns 0 otherwise
_Repo_
File: 4-isalpha.c
